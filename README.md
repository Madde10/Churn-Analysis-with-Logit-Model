# Churn-Analysis-with-Logit-Model
 Understand the predictors of churn through statistical inference
The file "TelcoChurn.xlsx" contains data from a sample of 7043 subscribers of telephone and/or Internet Services for a large telco. We want to create three separate models to understand the predictors of churn of (i) subscribers of telephone services, (ii) subscribers of internet services, and (iii) people who subscribe to both services.

We tested a Generilized Linear Model using Logit to model the data.
